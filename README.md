Eva is a [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16)-color scheme inspired by fighting scenes during the gloomy weather of Evangelion Unit-01 from [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion).

The themes in this repository were built by using [https://github.com/belak/base16-builder-go](https://github.com/belak/base16-builder-go).

## Color design
The scheme consists of three groups of colors representing fluorescent surfaces, solid surfaces, and background objects in the fighting scenes.
 - Fluorescent colors*: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/b.png" alt="blue" width="50"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/g.png" alt="green" width="50"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/y.png" alt="yellow" width="50"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/o.png" alt="orange" width="50"/>
 - Solid colors: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/r.png" alt="red" width="50"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/m.png" alt="magenta" width="50"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/v.png" alt="violet" width="50"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/c.png" alt="cyan" width="50"/>
 - Background colors: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/bg1.png" alt="bg1" width="50"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/bg2.png" alt="bg2" width="50"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/bg3.png" alt="bg3" width="50"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/bg4.png" alt="bg4" width="50"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/bg5.png" alt="bg5" width="50"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/bg6.png" alt="bg6" width="50"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/bg7.png" alt="bg7" width="50"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjakapat/resources/master/eva/images/bg8.png" alt="bg8" width="50"/>

\* The fluorescent color codes are from [Crayola crayon colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors#Fluorescent_crayons).

## Visibility
The visibility of the colors in this scheme divided into five groups according to their contrast ratios:
1. Background colors: consist of various shades of dark cyan, grey and white colors, the default background color (#2a3b4d) has a contrast ratio of 1.0,
2. Comments: the contrast ratio of the comments is 2.5, which makes the comments less visible and less distracted,
3. Normal texts: the contrast ratio of the normal texts is 4.5, as recommended in [G18: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html),
4. Solid-color texts: the contrast ratio of the solid colors is 3.0, this value makes the solid color texts more distinguishable from the fluorescent color texts,
5. Fluorescent-color texts: the contrast ratios of the colors in this category are more than 5.0, using to emphasize important parts of the codes such as classes, functions, methods, strings, integers, and so on.

_Note_: the contrast ratios calculated by comparing the target colors to the default background color (#2a3b4d).

_Note_: For anyone who wants to use the Eva theme with darker fluorescent colors, try the alternative [eva-dim scheme](https://github.com/kjakapat/base16-eva-scheme/blob/master/eva-dim.yaml), and for the improved visibility version, try [eva-darken scheme](https://github.com/kjakapat/base16-eva-scheme/blob/master/eva-darken.yaml).
